If you see errors like:
- "numpy.dtype size changed, may indicate binary incompatibility"
your base environment has mismatched compiled binaries (NumPy/Pandas/SciPy).

This notebook is SHAP-optional and runs without SHAP.
If pandas import fails, reinstall numpy+pandas consistently and restart kernel.
